# Web Site Automation using Junit
This project uses Selenium WebDriver with Node.js to interact with the Guest Registration Form(https://demo.wpeverest.com/user-registration/guest-registration-form/). The script fills in necessary fields, submits the form, and verifies the success message upon successful registration.
